# Overview

This project was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course. This project implements the **ID3** (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) Decision Tree algorithm, a fundamental method in machine learning used for classification tasks. The implementation allows training a decision tree using categorical datasets and classifying new data points based on the learned model.

## Features
- Implementation of the ID3 algorithm from scratch.
- Support for categorical datasets.
- Ability to train a decision tree using multiple datasets.
- Classification of new data using the trained model.
- Visualization of the decision tree structure.
- Dataset pre-processing including discretization and missing value handling.

## Notebook

The DecisionTreesFinal.html notebook provides a complete description of the assignment's process, including code, results and analysis.

## Other files and folders

Furthermore, we've also included all python classes and files mentioned in the Notebook, as well as the folder DS, which contains:

- the 4 original datasets (.csv files);
- the 4 datasets for testing (.csv files without the class label);
- the classified datasets for the larger ones (iris and connect4).

The decision_tree.txt includes the generated tree for the connect4, which was generated by running the following script: connect4gen.py.
